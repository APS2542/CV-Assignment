# CV-APP Assignment #1

This project implements multiple computer vision functions as required in the assignment:

1. Convert image color between RGB ↔ Grey ↔ HSV  
2. Contrast and brightness adjustment  
3. Show image histogram  
4. Gaussian filter with changeable parameter  
5. Bilateral filter with changeable parameters  
6. Canny edge detection  
7. Line detection using Hough Transform  
8. Create a panorama (custom implementation, no OpenCV stitcher)  
9. Image translation, rotation, and scale  
10. Camera calibration  
11. Augmented Reality with TREX model projection
